# PokeGuide
Guide tool for Pok√©mon games

Currently using data mix from https://github.com/veekun/pokedex and https://github.com/phalt/pokeapi

As Windows Phone App tile Images there are currently placeholders from some random image I found in the net, you should remove or replace them before distributing this app. They are in PokeGuide.WindowsPhone\Assets.

You need sqlite-wp81-winrt-3090200.vsix Visual Studio installer for Windows Phone 8.1 and/or sqlite-winrt81-3090200.vsix for Windows 8.1 from  http://sqlite.com/download.html to build Phone/App project
